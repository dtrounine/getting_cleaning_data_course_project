===================

The data set generated by [run_analysis.R](https://github.com/dtrounine/getting_cleaning_data_course_project/blob/master/run_analysis.R) script contains summarized data from the original "Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones" data set, published [here](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones).

Both train and test data are included in this dataset. Only the mean and standard deviation for each measurements were taken from original data. Then the average value of each variable for each subject and activity was calculated and included in this data set. The name of feature columns are basically the same as in original data set with removed illegal characters such as '-' or '(', ')'. All columns with description are listed below.

The data set contains 180 rows, each row containing avearage values of measurements for each subject and activity. These average values are normalized and bounded within [-1, 1].
